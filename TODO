-- TODO --

* Read up on, practice and then write up some more of the `sam` editing
  language. Structured regular expressions really do look wonderfully powerful
  and it would be good to be able to make proper use of them in general rather
  than simply as heavily commented "magic" lines in a couple of the utilities. *
  Combined with the point above about having a sort of 'command mode' similar to
  vim's Normal mode would allow me to do a lot of what I am after I think.

* Port over the logic in blobfish to work nicely with acme
  * There are probably a number of things that would be nice as a modified version of 'pick'
    that allowed for a much larger header?
  * That or something that let you do an "info + place to type commands" type interface


-- TO LOOK AT --

* Look at some other acme resources online:
  * Setting plumber rules: (https://github.com/karahobny/acme-utils/blob/master/acme-start.sh)
  * GitHub FS: (https://github.com/sirnewton01/ghfs)
  * Jira client: (https://github.com/hdonnay/Jira)
  * Github client: (https://pkg.go.dev/rsc.io/github/issue?utm_source=godoc)
  * Script ideas: (https://github.com/ianzhang366/acmescripts)
  * Cross platform hotkey solution? (https://github.com/golang-design/hotkey)
    * or this (https://github.com/robotn/gohook)


-- TO FIX / IMPROVE --

* snooper
  * rework the snooper window to instead act more like a menu than a log
    * just send the output to +Errors like everything else
    * show more of the available commands in the window
      * auto add based on the handlers that are registered?

* dirtree
  * Fuzzy file search
  * Bookmarked directories
  * Jump to dir based on edited line 1
  * keep focused line (where possible) when re-rendering

* pick
  * Make linePicker public so it can be used in other programs
  * Sort results by line number when enabled
    * Jumping to line is a little too fiddly at the moment

* gq
  * better detection of indentation styles (like these nested bullet points)
  * auto-set line lenth based on file type

* command-line
  * rewrite as a go program
  * Edit commands are not running correctly
  * store a command history as well maybe?
    * if this is integrated with the snooper then that can just be in memory

* window search
  * making this part of the snooper might be worthwhile as well?
  * would still need a script that send the correct message to the snooper
