-- TODO --

* sort out the command line script to be able to run edit commands correctly
  * store a command history as well maybe? (just in /tmp)

* Read up on, practice and then write up some more of the `sam` editing
  language. Structured regular expressions really do look wonderfully powerful
  and it would be good to be able to make proper use of them in general rather
  than simply as heavily commented "magic" lines in a couple of the utilities. *
  Combined with the point above about having a sort of 'command mode' similar to
  vim's Normal mode would allow me to do a lot of what I am after I think.

* Maybe write my own version of `win` that can work with tab completion? This
  wouldn't work with `rc` I don't think but it would let me use zsh maybe
  provided that I could disable all the widgets (otherwise the window in acme is
  going to EXPLODE...!)

* Look at adding more keyboard shortcuts (probably simplest to compile them in but
  it might be possible to source them dynamically from somewhere?)

* Improvements to dirtree
  * Fuzzy file search
  * Bookmarked directories
  * Jump to dir based on edited line 1

* Improvements to gq
  * better detection of indentation styles (like these nested bullet points)

* Rework the snooper window to instead act more like a menu than a log
  (just send the output to +Errors like everything else?)

* Port over the logic in blobfish to work nicely with acme
  * There are probably a number of things that would be nice as a modified version of 'pick'
    that allowed for a much larger header?
  * That or something that let you do an "info + place to type commands" type interface

* Look at some other acme resources online:
  * Setting plumber rules: (https://github.com/karahobny/acme-utils/blob/master/acme-start.sh)
