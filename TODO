-- TODO --

* Read up on, practice and then write up some more of the `sam` editing
  language. Structured regular expressions really do look wonderfully powerful
  and it would be good to be able to make proper use of them in general rather
  than simply as heavily commented "magic" lines in a couple of the utilities.
  * Combined with the point above about having a sort of 'command mode' similar
    to vim's Normal mode would allow me to do a lot of what I am after I think.

* Maybe write my own version of `win` that can work with tab completion? This
  wouldn't work with `rc` I don't think but it would let me use zsh maybe
  provided that I could disable all the widgets (otherwise the window in acme
  is going to EXPLODE...!)



-- Utility ideas --

* Jira management
  * actions
    * view a sprint
    * create tickets
    * view my notifications and assigned tickets
  * also want to be able to plumb open any jira ref in firefox
  * will probably need to pull in details from the environment

* Simple git commit creation
  * git status to get modified / untracked files
  * button 3 on a filename to stage
  * button 2 to open the diff for that file in a new window
  * commit message (summary + body) would need to be entered
    in a specific location in the window?
  * 'Commit' in the tag to create the commit.
