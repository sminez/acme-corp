-- TODO --

* vim style ':' to get a command line but instead just bounce focus up to the
  current window tag? This would make working quickly on common edit tasks that
  I make use of a little nicer. For example, deciding that a variable name needs
  changing, wanting to quickly spell check the current word under the cursor
  (which is particularly useful when writing comments or error messages in a
  source file as piping the entire thing through.
  * Having the disposible command line with history is actually really nice as
    opposed to cluttering up the tag though.

* Read up on, practice and then write up some more of the `sam` editing
  language. Structured regular expressions really do look wonderfully powerful
  and it would be good to be able to make proper use of them in general rather
  than simply as heavily commented "magic" lines in a couple of the utilities.
  * Combined with the point above about having a sort of 'command mode' similar
    to vim's Normal mode would allow me to do a lot of what I am after I think.

* If the key interception stuff works then see if there is a way to get something
  akin to vim motions working. Full blown vim editing is probably:
    a) a giant task
    b) not really in keeping with the spirit of things (simply `punt` to vim)
    c) the wrong way to go about things
  * All that said, I really do want a way to quickly select text for copying /
    replacing similar to vim's word, to-end-of-line, paragraph, within delimiters
    etc... style paradigm. That and being able to quickly grab a bunch of lines
    via the keyboard (shift-V / ctrl-v) is something I'm really missing.

* Maybe write my own version of `win` that can work with tab completion? This
  wouldn't work with `rc` I don't think but it would let me use zsh maybe
  provided that I could disable all the widgets (otherwise the window in acme
  is going to EXPLODE...!)



-- Utility ideas --

* Jira management
  * actions
    * view a sprint
    * create tickets
    * view my notifications and assigned tickets
  * also want to be able to plumb open any jira ref in firefox
  * will probably need to pull in details from the environment

* Simple git commit creation
  * git status to get modified / untracked files
  * button 3 on a filename to stage
  * button 2 to open the diff for that file in a new window
  * commit message (summary + body) would need to be entered
    in a specific location in the window?
  * 'Commit' in the tag to create the commit.
