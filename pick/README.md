pick - cross platform dmenu replacement
=======================================

I really want dmenu on my work OSX machine. I've found similar tools that are
OSX specific but nothing that works as easily as `dmenu` or that I can hack on
as most are written in Swift.

If you know `dmenu` you know the drill: pipe in a newline delimited text, select
the line you want and it will be returned to you on stdout. That's it.
