These are my assorted notes and thoughts on what I've learned about `acme`
and how I tend to make use of it as "A user interface for programmers".
Acme really is amazingly powerful and while you do give up some more modern
comforts such as syntax highlighting and autocomplete, you actually gain a
huge amount by going "full bell labs" and really embracing the paradigm of
"_everything_ is text".

I will also freely admit that I absolutely love hacking on things and acme
is a wonderful playground for this sort of thing. I'll also admit that, for
now, time critical stuff at work I still do in vim as that's what I am
most efficient in. Lets see if we can change that!

If you are viewing these files within acme itself then you should be able
to use acme mouse actions to open up and local docs references or URLs. In
the case of `go doc` commands, the simplest thing to do is double click just
after the leading paren and then imediately middle click (button 2) once the
text is highlighted. For man page references, provided you haven't completely
messed with your plumbing rules, a simple right (button 3) click should
suffice.
